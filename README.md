Key words: Risk modeling, mathematical optimization, AMPL, Python, Colab, Excel, Matplotlib

Document needs more update as of July 2025.

Phase 1 (April - May 2025): Original project with 3 contributors: Ramisa Tahsin Rahman, Mariam Fatima, Anh Pham.

Phase 2 (beyond May 2025): Modifications to improve model's reliability and sophistication. Plan by Anh Pham:

- Incorporate Backtesting: Use historical data (e.g., 2015–2020) to construct the portfolio and evaluate its performance on a later period (e.g., 2020–2025) to validate the model.
- Assess Model Assumptions: Reflect on whether relying on recent 5-year trends is realistic and consider testing robustness under different market scenarios.
- Strengthen Credibility: Use real-world benchmarking to build investor trust by demonstrating that the model produces reliable, believable results.
