# Portfolio_Optimization_SP25
Status: Document needs more update as of July 2025.

TLDR: An experimental project aimed at developing a simplified, accessible model for mathematical portfolio optimization.

Key words: Risk modeling, mathematical optimization, AMPL, Python, Colab, Excel, Matplotlib

A summary paper detailing the project's methodology, outcomes, and future directions is in progress and will be made public following revisions. Additional contributors may be acknowledged if the revisions draw upon their contributions.

Phase 1 (April - May 2025): Original project with 3 main contributors: Ramisa Tahsin Rahman, Mariam Fatima, Anh Pham. Special thanks to Dylan Shepardson for early guidance and feedback during the project planning phase.

Phase 2 (beyond May 2025): Modifications to improve model's reliability and sophistication. Plan by Anh Pham:

- Incorporate Backtesting: Use historical data (e.g., 2015–2020) to construct the portfolio and evaluate its performance on a later period (e.g., 2020–2025) to validate the model.
- Assess Model Assumptions: Reflect on whether relying on recent 5-year trends is realistic and consider testing robustness under different market scenarios.
- Strengthen Credibility: Use real-world benchmarking to build investor trust by demonstrating that the model produces reliable, believable results.
